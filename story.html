          Once they approached <b>South island's Capital City</b>, they landed to a spot where Sonic can build a boomtown, as Sonic pulled out the blueprint, they got ready for the big build. and after many minutes of building, they cheered happily and started inviting everyone to the boomtown. and they served food, and goodies for every guest. Later that night, a big flare wakes Sonic and Tunnel up. They look at the bright light in the night sky, thinking it's a new star, but it wasn't a new star...<br><br>

          The Prism Star Appears and meteors down and hits Sonic and Tunnel once they started to run, launching sonic far into the road and felt dizzy and then, when Sonic and Tunnel saw the Prism Star, they were shocked and frightened in Disney's Chicken Little Style, As Tails was cooking at night for the customers, A loud scream disturbs Tails' cooking and then the recipe explodes on Tails, causing Tails, Knuckles, Mighty, Ray, Amy, Metal Sonic & fang to come outside to tell what happened.<br><br>
            
          Sonic and Tunnel point to the Prism Star and they were shocked. Tails got everyone to see this strange star appear out of nowhere. As Fang touched the Prism Star, it teleported to another place. But then, Kuroku and the Krusty Kremlin krew appeared. and they were shocked that the Prism Star Disappeared, Sonic argued with Kuroku and Kuroku decided that he'll be going after the Prism Star First and send his Kremlin Krew to stop them from returning the Prism Star.<br><br>

          So Kuroku dashed off to get his hands on the prism star, Sonic decided to create a brigade called "The 5 Zatchitatos". Sonic, Tails, Metal Sonic, Amy & Ray unite together and went after the Prism Star too. The Adventure begins big time! Quest On!
